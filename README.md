## CS-320-Application Project
#Overview

This project is focused on creating a mobile application that provides contact, task, and appointment services. The application is designed to add, update, and delete contact, task, and appointment objects efficiently and effectively.

#Features
*   **Contact Service:** Manage contact information, including adding new contacts, updating existing contact details, and deleting contacts.
*   **Task Service:** Create, update, and delete tasks.
*   **Appointment Service:** add, update, and cancel appointments.

#Testing

Unit tests are written to verify that each component meets the customerâ€™s requirements.

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
*   Making sure your code, program, or software is functional and secure requires following several steps. Firstly, you must thoroughly test the code using different methods such as unit, integration, and system tests. Secondly, make sure to follow industry standards for coding to avoid errors and bugs. Finally, keep an eye out for potential threats and vulnerabilities by regularly reviewing your code, running analyses, and keeping up-to-date with the newest security fixes.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
*   Understanding what users want from the program is just as crucial. To do this effectively, you want to be sure that you communicate clearly with end-users and gather details about their requirements and limitations. Afterward, translate those demands into detailed instructions during the development phase. By frequently checking back with consumers throughout the project's life cycle, you may guarantee that the final product satisfies their demands. 

**How do I approach designing software?**
*   To approach designing software, begin by setting concrete goals and criteria before developing a high-level plan for the software architecture. Then, focus on the minute particulars of how each part would operate when designing the program.
